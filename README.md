# Another Gateway

This project is a personal project to develop a gateway using Rust Lang. 

Initially I plan to use this Gateway to control flow between his and applications behind him. 

It will be possible to create new applications and new flows between the Another Gateway and the applications, and the Another Gateway will generate metrics about this flow and a rate limit for this application or for the client that created this flow.
